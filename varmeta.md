### Your idea for fair funding of the proposal
We propose to receive the total grant of 345,000 (50K for Unity SDK, 25K for Metaverse Template, 120K NFT & COMMUNITY TOOLS FOR GAMES, 150K Valor Fantasy game) in five stages:
- The first stage: We would receive 10% of the grant immediately after approval.
- The second stage: Upon completion of the Unity SDK, we would receive 20% of the grant. This significant milestone warrants a larger portion of the funding given the technical complexity involved.
- The third stage: Upon completion of the NFT & COMMUNITY TOOLS FOR GAMES, we would receive 20% of the grant.
- The fourth stage: Upon completion of the Valor Fantasy game, we would receive 30% of the grant.
- The final stage: The remaining 10% will continue as commitments after 3 months of completing the milestones.

Our products will always be made public on our repositories. For the second and third stages, we will submit detailed reports and present our products for thorough review. 
We commit to updating our progress and making proposals every two weeks. This way, we ensure transparency and accountability in our use of the grant.

### What do you and the submission bring to the Gno.land platform and community?
- Our submission aims to enrich the Gno.land platform and its community by providing valuable resources for developers.
- With our SDKs, templates, and tools, we aim to streamline the process of developing metaverse applications and games on the Gno blockchain. This contributes to the growth and diversification of content on the platform, which will attract more users and developers.
- By making our products public on our repositories, we promote transparency and collaboration within the community. Developers can learn from our work, contribute to it, and even adapt it for their own projects.
  
In addition, our team is committed to active engagement with the community. We plan to provide regular updates, respond to feedback, and take part in discussions. We believe that our project and our team's proactive involvement will foster a more vibrant and innovative Gno.land community.
